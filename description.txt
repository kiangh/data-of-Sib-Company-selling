This project has 4 steps

sData pre-processing: In this section, in addition to getting to know more about the project data, you perform a series of preparation and pre-processing steps on the entire data.

Exploration: In this step, we answer a series of high-level questions and get an intuitive view of the company's financial information.

Studying the target markets: In the third step, we will analyze the sales and supply location and we will check in which countries despite having many customers, they experience low sales.

Valuing customers: In this step, we introduce a functional criterion called RFM, and based on this criterion, we divide the company's customers into 7 categories, each of which has its own meaning and behavior in terms of marketing.
